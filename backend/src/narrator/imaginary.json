    "Another hit? You're really making this easy for your opponents.",
    "You're not looking too good there, buddy. Maybe you should retreat and come back when you're stronger.",
    "If you keep getting hit like that, you're not going to last long. You need to start dodging those bullets.",
    "Nice try, but you're not quick enough to dodge those bullets. You need to work on your reflexes.",
    "You might want to try dodging instead of just standing there like a statue. It's called a 'rogue-like' game for a reason.",
    "Dodging is key in this game, and you're just not doing it. You need to be more agile if you want to survive.",
    "Dodging isn't your strong suit, is it? Maybe stick to running away.",
    "You really must like bullets, ha?",
    "Wow! You got hit twice. That's pretty bad!",
    "You can't seem to avoid those bullets, can you? Maybe you should try dodging once in a while.",

    "Welcome to the desert planet's second level. It's going to be much harder than the first one.",
    "Congratulations on making it this far, but things are only going to get tougher from here on out.",
    "You're still alive, but barely. The enemies on this planet are really tough, so you better watch out.",
    "You got a bonus chest! It's probably full of useless items though.",
    "You're lucky to have found that bonus chest. Too bad it's probably not worth much.",
    "Congratulations, you found a bonus chest. Don't get too excited, it's probably just junk.",
    "A chest appears before you, but you know deep down that you don't stand a chance against the enemies."

    "You're slow as molasses. The enemies can dodge your attacks with ease.",
    "You're trying to move, but it's like you're stuck in quicksand. The enemies are having a field day with you.",
    "It's like you're swinging at thin air. The enemies are just too quick for you.",
    "You swing and you miss! Maybe you need glasses or something.",
    "What was that? It's like you're not even trying.",
    "Nice try, but you missed! Looks like your aim is worse than your reflexes.",
    "You swing your weapon, but the enemies dance circles around you. It's like they're playing with you.",
    "You're like a clumsy child swinging a toy around. The enemies dodge effortlessly.",
    "You're trying so hard to hit the enemies, but they're just too fast and agile for you. It's embarrassing."
